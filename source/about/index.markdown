Welcome to our little corner of the blogging universe where we aim to keep you up to date on all the goings on in the world of social shopping data analysis.

We're here to gather data on the world of social shopping, starting out with daily deals, and dig through those piles of data to unearth some interesting trends and share them with you all.

We currently track the big daily deal providers and we'll be adding more as we go and hopefully sharing some interesting stats and insights along the way.

We'll be delivering our analysis in ongoing blog posts and issuing a monthly high level report. We're also currently working on providing api access and our data currently powers:

[bargainvista.com](http://bargainvista.com) - a social shopping aggregator

[alertrr.com](http://alertrr.com) - a shopping alert platform

If you're interested in beta access to our api platform or more detailed data reports please get in touch and we'll do our best [info@alertrr.com](mailto:info@alertrr.com)
