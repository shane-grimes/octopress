Over the last few years the world of daily deals and social shopping has proliferated right across the globe. We've always been fans of a good bargain and the larger and more competitive the markets became the more we became interested in the data behind this phenomenon.

So we've been spending the last few months fine tuning, testing and analysing a wealth of data we've collected in the world of daily deals. We're also expanding and continuing the tracking that we do to unearth a wider and more detailed data set to continue our analysis.

We've been targeting a few large market elements but we'll be expanding to include more providers in more locations and not just in the daily deal markets. If we can find data on any interesting social shopping provider we'll add it to our tracking list.

We're currently finalising the format and content of our reports which we'll be issuing on an ongoing basis that we hope will provide an interesting insight into the world of social shopping.

Over the coming days and weeks we'll be posting some analysis on various interesting trends that we've observed and we hope you'll stick around to find out what they are.
