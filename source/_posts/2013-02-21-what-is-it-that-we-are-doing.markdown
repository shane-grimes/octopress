We figure that makes a pertinent question for our first post all things considered. To put it in the simplest terms possible our aim is to make it easier for you to get alerted to deals and bargains, let us do the watching for you so you can be sure you won't miss out on anything interesting.

We're fans of a good bargain and the last few years of daily deals has certainly made deals and bargains much more widespread but with the neverending list of sites and deals and emails it's become something of a pain to keep track of them all, especially when the majority are of no interest.

And that's were we come in, you tell us what you're interested in and when something matches your preferences then we'll alert you. That's it, in short, we're your bargain hunting ninjas!

You can set your preferences based on country, city, category or pick keywords for something specific. We can send you a daily email roundup or an email or tweet when we find something that matches your preferences. It's up to you how you prefer to be notified.

At the moment we're covering the biggest deal sites and we're in the process of adding more. We intend to cover not just daily deal sites but ultimately as many shopping destinations as we can. If there's someone you'd like us to add please get in touch and let us know. The more feedback that we have on who to add the more we can give you what you want.

Our data on deals is currently provided by our sister site [datumetrics.com](http://datumetrics.com) which tracks deals and provides information on the social shopping ecosystem, so check that out too if that sort of thing interests you.

And if that sounds like it's up your street then what are you waiting for? Go [sign up](http://alertrr.com) already! You can log in with twitter or facebook and you'll set your preferences in 2 minutes and that's it, leave the rest to us.

We hope you enjoy the service and give us a shout if you have any questions [@alertrr](http://twitter.com/alertrr)
